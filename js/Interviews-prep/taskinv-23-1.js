// Difference between debouncing and throttling in JavaScript with example and explanation

// debouncing is used to prevent the function from being called multiple times in a short period of time, while throttling is used to limit the rate at which a function is called

// Throttling is used to limit the rate at which a function is called

// Reconsilation in React JS

//React Reconciliation refers to Reactâ€™s process of comparing the current and previous states of the Virtual DOM and updating the DOM efficiently. 
//It makes the DOM updates faster in React. 
//It updates the virtual DOM first and then uses the diffing algorithm to make efficient and optimized updates in the Real DOM.
